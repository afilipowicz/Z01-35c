**qualifier_code** | **str** | A code for the forecast qualifier applicable to the 12 hour forecast period. | [optional] 
**rh** | **int** | The daytime relative humidity of the air, which is defined as the ratio of the amount of water vapor in the air to the amount of vapor required to bring the air to saturation at a constant temperature. Relative humidity is always expressed as a percentage. | [optional] 
**shortcast** | **str** | An abbreviated sensible weather portion of narrative forecast. | [optional]

**temp** | **int** | The forecasted temperature for midpoint day (1pm) or midpoint night (1am) for a 12 hour daypart. | [optional] 
**temp_phrase** | **str** | The short phrase containing the forecasted high or low temperature for 12 hour forecast period. | [optional] 
**thunder_enum** | **int** | The enumeration of thunderstorm probability within an area for a 12 hour daypart. | [optional] 
**thunder_enum_phrase** | **str** | The description of probability thunderstorm activity in an area for 12 hour daypart. | [optional] 
**uv_desc** | **str** | The UV Index Description which complements the UV Index value by providing an associated level of risk of skin damage due to exposure. 2 is Not Available, -1 is No Report, 0 to 2 is Low, 3 to 5 is Moderate, 6 to 7 is High, 8 to 10 is Very High, 11 to 16 is Extreme | [optional] 
**uv_index** | **int** | Maximum UV index for the 12 hour forecast period. | [optional] 
**uv_index_raw** | **float** | The non-truncated UV Index which is the intensity of the solar radiation based on a number of factors. | [optional] 
**uv_warning** | **int** | TWC-created UV warning based on UV index of 11 or greater. | [optional] 
**vocal_key** | **str** | An encoded narrative forecast used for creating computer-generated audio narratives of the forecast period. TWC use only. | [optional] 
**wc** | **int** | Wind Chill - Minimum wind chill. An apparent temperature. It represents what the air temperature “feels like” on exposed human skin due to the combined effect of the cold temperatures and wind speed. When the temperature is 61°F or lower the Feels Like value represents the computed Wind Chill so display the Wind Chill value. For temperatures between 61°F and 75°F, the Feels Like value and Temperature are the same, regardless of wind speed and humidity, so display the Temperature value. | [optional] 
**wdir** | **int** | Daytime average wind direction in magnetic notation. | [optional] 
**wdir_cardinal** | **str** | Daytime average wind direction in cardinal notation. | [optional] 
**wind_phrase** | **str** | The phrase that describes the wind direction and speed for a 12 hour daypart. | [optional] 
**wspd** | **int** | Wind Speed - The maximum forecasted wind speed. The wind is treated as a vector; hence, winds must have direction and magnitude (speed). The wind information reported in the hourly current conditions corresponds to a 10-minute average called the sustained wind speed. Sudden or brief variations in the wind speed are known as “wind gusts” and are reported in a separate data field. Wind directions are always expressed as \&quot;from whence the wind blows\&quot; meaning that a North wind blows from North to South. If you face North in a North wind the wind is at your face. Face southward and the North wind is at your back. | [optional] 
**wxman** | **str** | The code to enable the Weather Man animation for forecast period. TWC use only. | [optional]
